   This is my first writing any blogs and posts. This shit is new to me so keep this in mind while reading. I will try to keep my posts bug free and any way all suggestions from you readers are welcome

##Before going any further, First let me answer some questions

<dl>
  <dt>1. Who am I </dt>
  <dd>I'am a student pursuing my bachelors and masters degree in chemical engineering from IIT Kharagpur. A huge fan of app development, I have started developing apps by self learning from 2011. The areas in which I develop apps range from simple websites in php/html to things like <abbr title="Web Real Time Communication">WebRTC</abbr>, <abbr title="Audio FingerPrinting">AFP</abbr>, Data Scraping</dd>

  <dt>2. How am I qualified in writing this blog realted to web development</dt>
  <dd>As mentioned above I have developed a total of 15 apps/websites in production, 4 more in development and various small scripts for data scraping. I also have done various <abbr title="Massive Open Online Courses">MOOC's</abbr> from various sites like Coursera, Stanford OpenEdx, Udemy, MongoDB University in areas like Algorithms, DB Management, Interactive Programming in Python, Machine Learning. So with all these experiences I think Iam qualified enough to write a blog post. Don't you think ?</dd>

  <dt>3. What post can you find in this blog</dt>
  <dd>This blog will contain posts realted to experiences/problems that I experienced while developing apps, latest stuff/tech in web developement starting from frameworks, languages and also some posts regarding information about my view on how one should start and proceed in learing  web app development</dd>

1. Tech Shout-out.
