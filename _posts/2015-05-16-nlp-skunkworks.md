title: Natural Language Processing using NLTK
---


<div class="message">
  It has been long since I have posted anything on this blog, recently I have started learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) using python's NLTK. I will be rolling out some 2-3 blog posts regarding the stuff that I have learnt, so it could be a noob guide.

As always I will start by giving some useless definition of NLP taken from wikipedia. So here it goes

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humanâ€“computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve natural language understanding, that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input, and others involve natural language generation.

So now that we got it over with, If you don't understand the above huge chunk of text don't worry I will be giving you a human definition based on my understanding (note: this is just my understanding, if there are any NLP Pundits who finds this offensive. I will correct it, just let me know).

According to me NLP is nothing but just a way to programatically understand a chunk of text and do some stuff with it. By understand I mean to know what the text is conveying, its sentiment, etc.

This kind of processing is useful in text based search engines, sentiment analysis of reviews, text summarization (for large body of text), text classification, etc. As told earlier it is very difficult to perfectly process a peice of text due to various problems like use of slangs, quality of language etc.

So with all the groud works stuff done, in this post I will provide you with resources regarding the installation and getting started resources.

### Installation

1. Install Python and then install pip & setup tools.
2. Using pip install nltk using `pip install -U nltk`
3. After nltk installation you need to download data provided with nltk. There are two ways to do it (GUI way, command line way). The download instructions for both can be found [here](http://www.nltk.org/data.html).

Once all the above is done you can now start writing programs using NLTK.

### Getting started & Resources

For getting started you can follow the official NLTK documentation or you can view youtube videos from a channel named sentdex [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) and the [nlp videos playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDf2JswnfiGkliBInZnIC4HL).

So thats it for this post, I hope this should get you started with nlp using nltk. In future posts I will add details about some of the projects on nlp which I have been working on.
